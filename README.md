## Exploring Used Car Sales Data: A Data Cleaning and Analysis Project
## Introduction
This is an exploratory data analysis project focused on car sales data from eBay Kleinanzeigen, the classified section of the German eBay website. The dataset comprises 50,000 data points, and the accompanying data dictionary includes fields such as the car's model, make, price, mileage, and more.

## Problems Solved
* Removed duplicates and unnecessary columns
* Dealt with missing values in various columns
* Cleaned up the dataset to ensure consistency and accuracy
* Explored relationships between different variables to uncover insights

## Skills Demonstrated
* Data cleaning and pre-processing
* Handling missing data and outliers
* Data exploration and visualization
* Basic statistical analysis


The exploration of the dataset produced the following interesting results:

Price to Brand: This shows the average price of the top brands of cars available for sale. Brands like Audi, BMW, Mercedes-Benz, and Volkswagen are the top brands available for sale with Audi being the most expensive.

Brand, Price, and Mileage Relationship: This shows the relationship between brand, price, and how far the cars have been driven. Due to the result not being clear enough, mileage and price were explored more.

Price to Mileage: In this table, mileage was grouped to better understand price to mileage, and it showed that cars with lower mileage are more expensive than cars with high mileage.

Brand to Model Combo: This shows the combination of cars that are more with Volkswagen-Golf combo being the most available combo and Volkswagen having more models.

State of Car to Price: This is to determine whether the state of the car (i.e. with or without damage) affects the price of the car. It showed that cars without damage are more expensive than cars with damages.

Overall, this project provided valuable insights into the used car market in Germany and can be used to inform purchasing decisions or further research in the field.

## Recommendation
* Sellers of cars with high mileage should consider lowering their prices to increase the chances of selling their cars.
* Dealerships should consider stocking more of the popular Volkswagen-Golf combo.
* Buyers should be aware that cars with damage are generally less expensive, but may require additional costs for repairs.
