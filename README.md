# Data Cleaning and Exploration of Used Cars from eBay Kleinanzeigen
This project involved cleaning and exploring a dataset of 50,000 used cars from eBay Kleinanzeigen, a classified section of German eBay website. The data cleaning process focused on Data Quality Assessment and involved removing irrelevant data, standardizing column names and language, removing wrong entries causing outliers in some columns, using the right data format for the columns, removing inaccurate data, and ensuring uniqueness by removing duplicates.

The exploration of the dataset produced the following interesting results:

Price to Brand: This shows the average price of the top brands of cars available for sale. Brands like Audi, BMW, Mercedes-Benz, and Volkswagen are the top brands available for sale with Audi being the most expensive.

Brand, Price, and Mileage Relationship: This shows the relationship between brand, price, and how far the cars have been driven. Due to the result not being clear enough, mileage and price were explored more.

Price to Mileage: In this table, mileage was grouped to better understand price to mileage, and it showed that cars with lower mileage are more expensive than cars with high mileage.

Brand to Model Combo: This shows the combination of cars that are more with Volkswagen-Golf combo being the most available combo and Volkswagen having more models.

State of Car to Price: This is to determine whether the state of the car (i.e. with or without damage) affects the price of the car. It showed that cars without damage are more expensive than cars with damages.

Overall, this project provided valuable insights into the used car market in Germany and can be used to inform purchasing decisions or further research in the field.
